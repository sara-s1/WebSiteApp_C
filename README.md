Her2Inhibitors

This website allows you to predict Bioactivity towards inhibting the Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) proteins. HER2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family, a family of receptors implicated in the pathogenesis of different types of cancers. The overexpression of HER2, specifically, is involved in many tumors: breast, gastric, prostate, head and neck, ovarian, and more. Therefore, HER2 became a chief target for anti-carcinogenic therapeutic agents.
